# personal-website-v2
Live site: https://cameronmccloskey.com

A Website focusing on showcasing my projects. This website uses 9 components to showcase information, map through and display content in different ways. Custom CSS and JSX is rendered for each view, and using CSS media queries the site is viewable even on older, legacy screens.
This website uses React-Router-Dom, React-Scroll, React-Icons, useEffect, useState, .map, conditional rendering, and modular components.
